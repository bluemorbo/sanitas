## About Sanitas

This project was initially conceived while compiling a list of ideas for the [UKFast](https://ukfast.co.uk) Hackathon 2020. 
The idea itself didn't really take shape until I personally experienced how difficult it was to share 
medical data with healthcare professionals, in the format that they wanted. So the idea of a website 
that allowed you to easily track and export your blood pressure data in a variety  of forms became 
an idea that intrigued me. 

Since medical data is highly personal, it's important that the end user has full transparency. By 
open-sourcing the site itself, they can see for themselves exactly what is and what isn't being stored.

This website is built using [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and the [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com) 
stack of [JetStream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/). There's some questionable [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) 
across the repository too.  

While the site in its current form isn't quite where I want it to be, it's also been used as an opportunity 
to learn the newer features to the Laravel framework. Ultimately I'd like to make everything powered by Livewire 
and look to start adding support for additional health metrics such as weight and mental health. Moving forwards, 
email reminders for appointments and tracking changes in medication have also been considered.
